# Duplicator
Minecraft mod that adds a block to duplicate other blocks because... well... why not?

## Hmm?
### But really why?
Okay, in all honesty, this isn't a real mod, this is simply a tester mod for me to expand upon my knowledge learnt from making my [Advanced Xray](https://github.com/michaelhillcox/XRay-Mod) mod. 

### Why Duplicator though?
Sometimes, when I play mod packs and encounter a mod that has a time based progression system and I'm in a lazy mood or I'm just way to busy to grind... I may, sometimes, exploit known duplication glitches to allow me to duplicate the item. This mod simply allows me to have a simple way of doing this for those times. 

### You released this?
Yeah, of course I did! if I wanted it then I'm sure at least one other person wants it. Sure, some will abuse it but thats their own choice. It's just a fun OP mod. No difference to a block that generates cobble... well, okay. Maybe it's a bit worse than that but shhh.
